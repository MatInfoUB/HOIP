## Accelerated Machine Learning Aided Property Prediction of Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites

A neural network based toolbox for hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite that enables the prediction 
of the following properties:

| Properties |
|----------------------|
| relative   energy  |
| HSE         bandgap  |
| refractive  index    |
| dielectric  constant, electronic |
| dielectric  constant, ionic |
| dielectric  constant, total |

To install the toolbox, download the code, install the requirements and execute the following command 
from the HOIP directory

`python test.py`
